I am very happy with the final look of this project, especially with the level design and the level shortcuts that change the scenery and player movement.

What I Did:

Art & VFX – Animations, tornado and gravity VFX, post-processing, and toon shader materials.
Custom Shaders – Stylized water and lava with a toon effect.
