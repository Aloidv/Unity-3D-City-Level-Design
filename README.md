I am very happy with the final look of this project, especially with the level design and the level shortcuts that change the scenery and player movement.

What I Did:
Design & Programming – Level design docs, triggers, movement, collectibles, and game management.
Art & VFX – Animations, tornado and gravity VFX, post-processing, and toon shader materials.
Custom Shaders – Stylized water and lava with a toon effect.
